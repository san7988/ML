# ML
My ML repo : Contains various small project from kaggle, coursera etc

=> Leaf Classification : https://www.kaggle.com/c/leaf-classification
The dataset can be downloaded from the kaggle link. I tried with different classifiers but SVN and LDA gave good results. DecisionTreeClassifier didn give very encouraging results.
