# ML
This ML repo : Contains various small project from kaggle, coursera, other blogposts etc

=> Leaf Classification : https://www.kaggle.com/c/leaf-classification
The dataset can be downloaded from the kaggle link. I tried with different classifiers but SVN and LDA gave good results. DecisionTreeClassifier didn give very encouraging results.

=> Email classifier : a sample binary spam/no spam classifier. Tests were run on enron raw emails(http://www2.aueb.gr/users/ion/data/enron-spam/). Followed blogpost of zac stewart(http://zacstewart.com/) for this toy problem.
