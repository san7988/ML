Part of Attemp Range Prediction Hackathon conducted by IIT BHU on analytics vidhya.
The data being very small has been uploaded(data folder)
Models using both XGBoost and Light Gradient Boost.
The lowest validation error on XGBoost was ~0.47%.
The lowest log loss on training set using Light Gradient Boost was ~1.39 
The highest F1 score on the submission was around ~0.40. The first position on leaderboard had a F1 score of ~0.52.
As and when I improve the model, I'll add the changes.
